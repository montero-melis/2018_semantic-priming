## Simulate data from semantic priming task to get a feeling for power and
## other characteristics of the data and analyses.


# TO DO:

# Basic procedure: For each set of simulated data, check:
#   
#   1) Significant priming effect?
#   2) Is the correlation between the actual by-subject random adjustment and the BLUP significant?
# 
# Manipulate:
# - For starters, simulate data with values based on SPP
# - Then reduce the priming effect and/or augment the resid. noise
# - Change the number of items and subjects
# - Change the variability between subjects and items
