TO DO -- Stimuli selection
=========================

For English
-----------

1. Select targets with following criteria:

- Targets elicit a strong priming effect
- Targets and primes -- both the related and unrelated prime -- are frequent
enough to be known by L2 speakers (use a sensible threhshold)
- Avoid certain types of semantic relation that could be of a more idiomatic
kind, like forward/backward phrasal associates. Best if this can be somewaht
homogeneous.
- Avoid prime-target pairs that conceptually overlap with critical pairs (e.g.,
PUSH-shove)
- Avoid idiosyncratic items (e.g., proper names: JESUS-christ, ENGLAND-britain)


2. Check targets, primes and unrelated are counterbalanced:

I.e.:

- A target has to appear both in the related and unrelated condition
- A prime has to also appear as the unrelated pair of another target
- Within a list, each target and prime appear only once


3. Check primes for nonwords

Check whether in SPP nonwords were paired with primes that were used for the
actual targets as well. To do that, see if any of the primes in the NW-trials
from the Eprime list is also one of the target/prime/unrelated (I doubt that)


4. Nb of items we need

- 24 word items (12 related, 12 unrelated)
- 24 NW items


5. Check lexical properties of final selection

Add ELP info to final selection and check that things like LogFrequency, etc.
match up.


6. Add the nonwords for all items

Choose them from SPP list and add to all items irrespective of condition and
whether critical or not.


7. Create output lists for Eprime
